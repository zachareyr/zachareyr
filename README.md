- 👋 Hey, I'm Zach
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general. I know Python, C, Java, & C#. I work on all sorts of projects, just trying to find my niche I guess
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and problem solving through Harvard's CS50, offered by EdX (really nice class, definitely reccomend)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing atm
- 📫 You can reach me on discord at zongo#2708
